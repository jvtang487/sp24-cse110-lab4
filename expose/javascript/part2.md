1. It will print 2. Since the for loop goes through incrememting i it outputs to the console the last vaule of i.
2. This will print 150. Since the last value of i is 2, then prices[i] would be 300, and the discount is 0.5 so half of that is 150.
3. This would print 150. Final price takes thte last discounted prices which is 150 and rounds it which is just 150.
4. It would return [50, 100, 150]. Since the final price of each is pushed after the array discounted is populated with the discounted price.
5. This would cause an error since let is declares the variables inside the function it is able to be accessed outside of it.
6. This would cause an error since let is declares the variables inside the function it is able to be accessed outside of it.
7. This would return 0. Since final price is originally declared to 0. The variables inside do not change it.
8. This would return []. Since it is declared originally empty but pushing it inside the for loop does not change it.
9. It would cause an error since let declars it inside the for loop not being able to be accessed.
10. It would return 3 since hte length is const of an array sized 3.
11. This function would return [] since it is declared a const it can't be changed.
12. A. student.name 
    B. student['Grad Year'] 
    C. student[greeting] 
    D.student['Favorite Teacher'].name 
    E. student.courseLoad[0]
13. A. '32' since '3' is a string representation it maps to exact string representation 
    B. 1 Since you can't subtract literal string the arithmetic is run. 
    C. 3 null is defaulted to 0 
    D. '3null'it maps to exact string representation 
    E. 4 true has the numeric value 1 
    F. 0 false and null both have the value 0 
    G.'3undefined' it maps to exact string representation
    H. NaN undefined does not have a value so it can't subtract
14. A. true 2 becomes a number and 2 is greater than 1
    B. false 2 is lexicograpgically greater than 12
    C. true 2 becomes a number 2 is equal to 2
    D. false they are different types
    E. false true as a number is 1 which is not equal to 2
    F. true they are both booleans
15. The == sign compares the two values if they are the same the === compares if they are both the same type
